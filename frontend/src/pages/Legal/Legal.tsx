        <strong>User-submitted information:</strong> When using the website, you might submit a
        username, text content, drawings, and cast votes. This data is collected and kept in our
        database to allow users to view history of past games. This data is <strong>not</strong>{' '}
        shared with any third party.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        <strong>User-submitted information when creating an account:</strong> If you choose to
        create an account on the website, you submit an email address and a password. The email is
        used as an unique identifier to guarantee that only you can access your account. For that
        purpose, we may send you occasional emails for security purposes, such as email address
        verification or password reset. We do <strong>not</strong> send marketing emails.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        The password is safely stored in our database in an encrypted format. Email addresses and
        passwords are <strong>not</strong> shared with any third party.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        <strong>Information provided by social authentication providers:</strong> If you choose to
        create an account on the website using either Facebook or Google, these providers provide us
        with a short-lived token. We do not keep that token, we use it once to retrieve your email
        address and basic profile information (in the case of Facebook, this also includes your name
        and profile picture), and then discard the token. We only keep the email address, which is
        used as an unique identifier to guarantee that only you can access your account. For that
        purpose, we may send you occasional emails for security purposes, such as email address
        verification or password reset. We do <strong>not</strong> send marketing emails.
      </LegalParagraph>
      <LegalParagraph>
        The other information that may be provided by the social authentication provider, besides
        your email address, is immediately discarded. It is <strong>not</strong> kept in database.
        It is not currently possible to prevent Facebook and Google from providing us some
        unnecessary information.
