# Passe un Dessin

Un jeu en ligne qu'il est bien.

## Helping out

Passe un Dessin is a non-profit side project made by a handful of people on dozens of hours of their free time. There is no money income (no membership or ads), just server costs (around 20â‚¬ / month).

The core team has been very happy to receive many contributions coming from enthusiastic players. If you want to help out too, you can:

- by submitting feedback or bug reports as [issues](https://github.com/foucdeg/passe-un-dessin/issues/new)
- if you have coding skills in Javascript (esp. React and Typescript) and/or Python (esp. Django) and want to help with features or bugfixes, have a look at the existing issues and comment if you'd like to work on one. I'm available by email to help you get started (see below).
- if none of the above apply and you've got a bit of money to spare, you can contribute to server costs via Paypal.
